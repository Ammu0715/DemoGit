1. What is Java?
Ans:Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. 
It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, which means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
that support Java without the need for recompilation.
2.What is a functional interface in Java?
Ans: A functional interface in Java is an interface that has exactly one abstract method.
They can have any number of default or static methods. Functional interfaces are used primarily in lambda expressions and method references.
3. What is a thread in Java?
Ans:A thread in Java is a lightweight process that allows concurrent execution of code. 
The Thread class and Runnable interface are used to create and manage threads.
4.What is the JVM?
Ans:he Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. 
The JVM converts Java bytecode into machine language and executes it. This allows Java programs to be platform-independent.
5.What is an object in Java?
Ans:An object is an instance of a class. It contains state (represented by fields) and behavior (represented by methods). 
Objects are created using the new keyword followed by the class constructor.
6. What is a class in Java?
Ans:A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects and defines a type of object according to the methods and variables 
that are included in the class. A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object.
7.What is inheritance in Java?
Ans: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where one class (the subclass) inherits the fields and methods of another class (the superclass). 
It allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.
8.What is polymorphism in Java?
Ans: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
In Java,polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding(run-time polymorphism) and method overloading(compile-time polymorphism).
9. What is encapsulation in Java?
Ans: Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit. 
In Java,it is achieved by using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the values of the fields
10.What is an exception in Java?
Ans: An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. In Java, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks.
 Exceptions can be checked (compile-time) or unchecked (run-time).
